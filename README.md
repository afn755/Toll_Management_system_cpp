Toll System Management

This C++ program simulates a toll system management system with three toll booths (Box1, Box2, Box3) and different categories of vehicles. The program uses classes and structures to represent vehicles, toll information, and the toll system.

Key Components:

•	Vehicle Class:

Represents a vehicle with attributes like vehicle type (Light-duty, Medium-duty, Heavy-duty) and vehicle number.
Provides methods to retrieve vehicle number and type.
•	Toll Information Structure:

Stores toll-related information for each vehicle, including car number, date of toll payment, tax amount, and ticket number.
•	Toll System Class:

Manages a vector of TollInformation objects.
Provides methods to add toll entries, search for entries based on vehicle number, generate total revenue, and retrieve toll tax based on vehicle type.
•	Usage in Main:

Creates instances of the Vehicle class to represent different vehicles with their types and numbers.
Three TollSystem instances (tollBox1, tollBox2, tollBox3) are created to simulate three toll booths.
Generates toll entries for each vehicle, including date, tax amount, and ticket number.
Calculates and prints the tax collected by each toll box.
Displays the total revenue generated by all toll boxes.
•	Important Note:

The program utilizes the <ctime> library to capture the current date and time for each toll entry.
The toll tax is calculated based on the vehicle type (Light-duty, Medium-duty, Heavy-duty).

How to Use:

Run the program to simulate toll collection for different vehicles and toll booths.
The program displays the tax collected by each toll box and the total revenue generated by all toll boxes.
